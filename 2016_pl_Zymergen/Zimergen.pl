## 
#  The goal is to tally up the sales results from the quarter.
#  
#  The sales report input follows a CSV format with columns like the
#  following:
#  Week    Product1  Product2  Product3 ...
#     0      568.15    180.12    513.40
#     1      581.34    312.01    480.02
#    ...
#    11      545.34    134.62    502.10
# 
#  For each week, we display the sales generated from each of N products
#  represented in the second through N+1â€™th columns of the CSV. The 1st
#  column indicates the week number.
#
#  Each quarter consists of 12 weeks. This method generates
#  a sales report with the following aggregate data:
# 
#  * The total value associated with each week.
#  * Identify the week with the highest sales.
#  
#  Returns:
#     a record representing a sales report containing the figures of merit 
#     described above.

# Part 2: Assume the following additional requirements are added to the Sales Report:

# The record must contain:
#  -- The total sales associated with each product over the quarter.
#  -- The average weekly sales associated with each product.
#  -- Products should be indexed by product name in the report.
