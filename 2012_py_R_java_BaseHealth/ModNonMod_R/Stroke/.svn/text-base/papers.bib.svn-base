	entities that share risk factors, and for which case-control and
	cross-sectional studies have shown a strong association. Stroke of
	respiratory centers can lead to apnea. Snoring preceding stroke,
	documentation of apneas immediately prior to transient ischemic attacks,
	the results of autonomic studies, and the circadian pattern of stroke,
	suggest that untreated OSA can contribute to stroke. Although cohort
	studies indicate that OSA is a stroke risk factor, controversy surrounds
	the cost-effectiveness of the screening for and treatment of OSA
	once stroke has occurred.},

  abstract = {Intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage have different
	pathogeneses and risk factor profiles. However, little information
	is available on the difference between intracerebral and subarachnoid
	hemorrhages in relation to blood pressure. We prospectively investigated
	the relationships between blood pressure and risks of stroke subtypes.
	We measured blood pressure and other cardiovascular risk factors
	in 100,147 men and 59,558 women 35 to 59 years of age in 1990 and
	1992. Outcomes were fatal and nonfatal events of stroke and its subtypes
	from 1993 to 2002. Independent relationships between baseline blood
	pressure and stroke subtypes were assessed using Cox's proportional
	hazard models. During the 10 years, 1714 ischemic and 1159 hemorrhagic
	strokes (742 intracerebral and 308 subarachnoid hemorrhages) occurred.
	Blood pressure was related more closely with hemorrhagic stroke than
	ischemic stroke, and the difference was more prominent in women.
	Among the subtypes of hemorrhagic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage
	was more closely related with blood pressure than subarachnoid hemorrhage.
	For each 20 mm Hg increase in systolic blood pressure, adjusted relative
	risks of ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoid
	hemorrhage were 1.79 (95\% confidence interval, 1.68 to 1.90), 2.48
	(2.30 to 2.68), and 1.65 (1.38 to 1.97) in men, and 1.64 (1.42 to
	1.89), 3.15 (2.61 to 3.80), and 2.29 (1.82 to 2.89) in women, respectively.
	In conclusion, blood pressure is more closely related with intracerebral
	hemorrhage than subarachnoid hemorrhage, thus proportion of intracerebral
	hemorrhage in hemorrhagic stroke may affect the association between
	blood pressure and hemorrhagic stroke. Our data also emphasize the
	importance of blood pressure control for the prevention of stroke,
	especially in countries with a high incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage.},

  abstract = {The prevalence of stroke is increased in individuals with heart failure
	(HF). The stroke mechanism in HF may be cardiogenic embolism or cerebral
	hypoperfusion. Stroke risk increases with decreasing ejection fraction
	and low cardiac output is associated with hypotension and poor survival.
	We examine the relationship among blood pressure level, history of
	stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA), and HF.We compared the prevalence
	of self-reported history of stroke or TIA in the REasons for Geographic
	And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) participants with HF (as
	defined by current digoxin use) and without HF. We excluded participants
	with atrial fibrillation or missing data. We examined the relationship
	between HF and history of stroke/TIA within tertiles of systolic
	blood pressure (SBP) adjusting for patient demographic and health
	characteristics.Prevalent stroke/TIA were reported by 66 (26.3\%)
	of 251 participants with and 1805 (8.5\%) of 21 202 participants
	without HF (P<0.0001). Within each tertile of SBP, the unadjusted
	OR (95\% CI) for prior stroke/TIA among those with HF compared with
	those without HF (the reference group) was, 4.0 (2.8 to 5.8) for
	SBP <119.5 mm Hg, 2.7 (1.8 to 3.9) for SBP >or=119.5 but <131.5 mm
	Hg, and 2.3 (1.6 to 3.2) for SBP >or=131.5 mm Hg. After adjustment,
	the relationship between prior stroke/TIA and HF remained significant
	only within the lowest tertile of SBP (<119.5 mm Hg; 3.0; 1.5 to
	6.1).The odds of prevalent self-reported stroke/TIA are increased
	in participants with HF and most markedly increased in participants
	with low SBP. Longitudinal data are needed to determine whether this
	reflects stroke/TIA secondary to thromboembolism from poor cardiac
	function or secondary to cerebral hypoperfusion.},

  abstract = {The role of circulating lipids and lipoproteins in the pathogenesis
	of ischemic stroke remains uncertain despite 3 decades of research.
	We examined this issue in a large population-based cohort.Between
	1987 and 1989, 14 175 middle-aged men and women, free of clinical
	cardiovascular disease, took part in the first examination of the
	Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study cohort. Baseline
	measurements included plasma levels of LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol,
	apolipoprotein B, apolipoprotein A-1, and triglycerides and myriad
	risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The cohort was followed
	for cardiovascular disease end points.Over an average follow-up of
	10 years (142 704 person-years at risk), we documented clinical ischemic
	stroke in 305 participants (161 men and 144 women). After multivariable
	adjustment for stroke risk factors, categorical and spline regression
	analyses of the entire sample, as well as the sample of men alone,
	revealed weak and inconsistent associations between ischemic stroke
	and each of the 5 lipid factors. Among women, the most consistent
	findings were decreasing risk of ischemic stroke within the top half
	of the distribution of HDL cholesterol and increasing risk within
	the lower range of the triglyceride distribution.The relation of
	circulating cholesterol to ischemic stroke does not resemble its
	well-known relation to coronary heart disease. Either the pathogenesis
	of a substantial proportion of ischemic strokes does not involve
	classic atherosclerotic mechanisms, or the effect of plasma lipids
	on atherogenesis is substantially different in the intracranial vascular
	bed.},
