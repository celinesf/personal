\begin_layout Title
Variant selection algorithm 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a specific disease and ethnicity, we want to chose a list of genetic
 variations (called variants)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
with convising evidence of association (i.e., replicated data).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
independent from each other (i.e., belong to different genes and genes are
 not in Linkage disequilibrium.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each of those chosen variations we want to use the best association
 value (odd ratio):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Largest sample size
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Best study design

\begin_layout Standard
The following describes the logic we use decide which variations and odd
 ratios will be considered for a spcific disease and ethnicity.

Variant scoring
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As an initial phase, each studied variant is assigned a score describing
 the strenght of its association with a specific disease in a specific ethnicity.
