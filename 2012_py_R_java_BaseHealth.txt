various R and python scripts developed at Basehealth,
The main pipelines are 

-------------------algogene-pipeline 
AlgoGenePipeline.py <Disease_name> <lifetime_prevalence>: 
   I)   variant aggregation : all the information is gathered for the genetic variation of interest
   II)  Data aggregation    : all the variants are aggregated for the disease of interest
   III) Data selection      : good variants are selected for the disease of interest (QC & selection routine)
   IV)  Adjusted calculation: selected variatns go throug adjusted odds ration calculation
   V)   Ethnicity decision  : Genophen covers about 6 different ethinicities at the time of this writting. what is the default ethnicity for the disease of interest

--------------------GenophenVariantSelection
Dev environment of steps I to III above 
+ documentation GenophenVariantSelection-doc can be seen using "Yed" application

----------------DbSnpPipeline 
 extracts dbsnp information from XML file:
- XmlDbsnp2Json.py :  Convert xml dbsnp data into json
- SimpleDbSnpInfo: Simplify dbsnp json structure
-GatherSnpInfo: perform quality control on GatherSnpInfo data
    1) check alleles strand
    2) check minor allele for + strand
    3) check reference allele on + strand
    4) check ancestral allele on +


----------------  ModNonMod_R
R scripts to obtain OR for non genetic risk factor per disease

-------------- haplophyzer_java
java code translation of  python code in phasing-script
