# Counting Point Mutations

![img.Figure 2](Hamming_distance.png)
Figure 2. The Hamming distance between these two strings is 7. Mismatched symbols are colored red.

## Problem

Given two strings $s$ and $t$
 of equal length, the **Hamming distance** between $s$ and $t$, denoted $d_H(s,t)$, is the number of corresponding symbols that differ in $s$ and $t$
. See Figure 2.

**Given**: Two DNA strings $s$
 and $t$
 of equal length (not exceeding 1 kbp).

**Return**: The Hamming distance $d_H(s,t)$.
